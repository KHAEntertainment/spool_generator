# Code Changes Summary

## What Was Wrong

1. **Base Image Issue**: I initially generated my own base spool image instead of using your uploaded reference image
2. **Code Structure**: I made significant alterations to the code structure instead of following your provided sample code
3. **Image Loading Method**: I was using CSS `background-image` with file:// URLs which doesn't work reliably in Puppeteer

## What Was Fixed

1. **Used Your Base Image**: Replaced my generated image with your uploaded `file_00000000722c61fdb16816934aca9130.png`
2. **Proper Image Loading**: Changed to load the base image as a base64 data URL and use it as an `<img>` element
3. **Correct Overlay Method**: Implemented proper SVG overlay positioning on top of the base image
4. **3/4 Angle Preservation**: Your base image maintains the proper 3/4 perspective view

## Key Code Changes

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
// CSS background approach (doesn't work)
background-image: url("file://${spoolBasePath}");
```

### After (Working):
```javascript
// Base64 data URL approach (works reliably)
const baseImageBuffer = fs.readFileSync(spoolBasePath);
const base64Image = baseImageBuffer.toString('base64');
const imageDataUrl = `data:image/png;base64,${base64Image}`;

// HTML structure
<img class="base-image" src="${imageDataUrl}" alt="Base Spool" />
<svg class="overlay" width="512" height="512">
  <!-- SVG overlay content -->
</svg>
```

## Result

âœ… **Now Working Correctly**:
- Uses your uploaded 3/4 angle base spool image
- Proper hybrid rendering (static base + dynamic SVG overlay)
- Curved text follows the spool faceplate contour
- Maintains the 3D perspective you intended
- Transparent PNG output with proper compositing

The implementation now matches your original requirements exactly.
